# MVMR-cML-SuSiE

### Overview
This repository provides a demonstration on how to use the MVMR-cML-SuSiE `R` source code.

# System Requirements

## Software Requirements

### OS Requirements

The source code has been tested on Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system and Linux (Ubuntu 18.04). The source code should be compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems.

Before using the DrFARM source code, users should have `R` version 4.3.0 or higher, and several packages installed.

### Installation  

First, we need to install a few dependencies `TwoSampleMR`, `susieR`, `MRcML` and `MVMRcML`:  

    install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR")

    install.packages("susieR")

    install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("xue-hr/MRcML")
    devtools::install_github("ZhaotongL/MVMR-cML")
    
which should install within a couple of minutes on a standard machine. Please refer to the corresponding Github for help if the `R` package cannot be installed properly.

# Demo

We first load all the source code dependencies:

```
library(TwoSampleMR)
library(susieR)
library(MRcML)
library(MVMRcML)
```

and the source code containing all the main functions:

```
source("main.R")
```
